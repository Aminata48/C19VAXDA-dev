For exemple, the ComitÃ© sur l'immunisation du QuÃ©bec (CIQ) considers the 2 vaccines interchangeable. People given a different vaccine for their 2nd dose should be just as well protected as those who get the same one.\n\nBased on the available data on vaccine interchangeability, it is recommended that the same vaccine be used for the 2nd dose if it is readily available at the vaccination clinic. However, the CIQ states that when administering the 2nd dose, if the messenger RNA vaccine used in the 1st dose is not readily available, a person may receive a different messenger RNA vaccine.\n\nThe messenger RNA vaccines are considered interchangeable and both doses received are considered valid."

However, your second dose may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose, if necessary.

        "faqanswer": "Understanding of COVID-19 variants is changing all the time. Research is ongoing to determine if new variants affect how effective the authorized vaccines are at preventing infection and disease.\n\nEven if a COVID-19 vaccine isnât as effective against a variant, people who have received two doses will have better protection against both getting the virus and getting sick from the virus. Thatâs why itâs so important to get your second dose.\n\nThe vaccine also protects against variants in another way. The more a virus spreads to people, the greater chance it may mutate and potentially become a variant. The more people who are vaccinated, the better to help slow the spread and reduce the chance of new variants."

      {
        "faqheader": "Why You should get vaccinated?",
        "faqanswer": "There are numerous reasons to get vaccinated. For instance, we do it to protect ourselves from the complications and risks associated with several communicable diseases, but also to avoid the reappearance of infectious diseases that are avoidable through vaccination."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "What types of COVID-19 vaccines are being studied?",
        "faqanswer": "Three types of vaccine are currently being studied.\n\nRNA vaccines: These vaccines activate the immune system by using part of the virusâs RNA.\nVector vaccines: These vaccines use genetically modified viruses that are harmless to humans.\nProtein-based vaccines: These vaccines contain non-infectious pieces of proteins that mimic the virusâs membrane."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "Who can receive the COVID-19 vaccine?",
        "faqanswer": "People over the age of 12 can receive the vaccine unless they have contraindications. Studies are ongoing in order to authorize vaccination for people under the age of 12."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "Are the vaccines safe?",
        "faqanswer": "Yes. The COVIDâ19 vaccines were the subject of rigorous testing involving a large number of people and underwent all the necessary steps before being approved. Every step required for approval was followed and some took place simultaneously, which explains why the process was so fast. Health Canada always conducts an extensive analysis of vaccines before approving them, paying particular attention to evaluating their safety and efficacy.Vaccines against COVID-19 are subject to the same rigorous scientific requirements and quality standards, and the same testing and post-market monitoring as any other vaccine approved for use in Canada."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "Are the vaccines \"experimental\"?",
        "faqanswer": "The COVID-19 vaccines went through the same types of testing as all other authorized vaccines in Canada.\n\nBefore a vaccine is tested in humans, it goes through laboratory and animal studies to assess its safety and its ability to protect from infection and disease. Then it goes through several phases of human clinical trials to further assess and confirm its safety and efficacy, including possible side effects.\n\nEach COVID-19 vaccine authorized in Canada was tested on tens of thousands of volunteers in high quality randomized controlled trials before being authorized by Health Canada and made available in Canada.\n\nTesting has to show that a vaccine is safe, effective and of high quality before it is authorized in Canada. There is ongoing monitoring of the safety and efficacy of the vaccines after they are made available."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "How did they develop the vaccines so fast?",
        "faqanswer": "Past efforts, particularly during the SARS epidemic in 2003, advanced coronavirus vaccine research and accelerated the fight against COVID-19. There are currently over 50 COVID-19 vaccines undergoing clinical trials around the world, the result of unprecedented scientific collaboration. Considerable financial and human resources were invested in order to quickly develop vaccines that meet regulatory requirements. Public health and regulatory authorities in several countries, including Canada, are actively working to ensure as many safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are available as quickly as possible."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "What is the process for developing a vaccine?",
        "faqanswer": "Bringing a new vaccine to the public involves many steps including vaccine development, clinical trials, Health Canada authorization or approval, manufacturing, and distribution. Many different public organizations and private companies have worked together to make COVID-19 vaccines available to the public. While COVID-19 vaccines were developed rapidly, all steps have been taken to ensure their safety and effectiveness."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "How effective is vaccination?",
        "faqanswer": "The vaccine is thought to be over 90% effective after two doses. For young people, disease-prevention efficacy is 100% after 2 doses. The 2nd dose is needed to further reduce the virusâs ability to spread, extend the period of immunity, and improve the vaccineâs effectiveness, particularly against certain variants.\n\nEfficacy after two doses of the messenger RNA vaccine in preventing disease caused by the Delta variant is around 90%, compared  96% in preventing hospitalizations."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "Are the vaccines interchangeable?",
        "faqanswer": "The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are similar in terms of how they work and their ingredients. For exemple, the ComitÃ© sur l'immunisation du QuÃ©bec (CIQ) considers the 2 vaccines interchangeable. People given a different vaccine for their 2nd dose should be just as well protected as those who get the same one.\n\nBased on the available data on vaccine interchangeability, it is recommended that the same vaccine be used for the 2nd dose if it is readily available at the vaccination clinic. However, the CIQ states that when administering the 2nd dose, if the messenger RNA vaccine used in the 1st dose is not readily available, a person may receive a different messenger RNA vaccine.\n\nThe messenger RNA vaccines are considered interchangeable and both doses received are considered valid."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "How many doses of COVID-19 vaccine will I need to get?",
        "faqanswer": "The number of doses needed depends on which vaccine you receive. To get the most protection:\n\nTwo Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses should be given 3 weeks (21 days) apart.\nTwo Moderna vaccine doses should be given 1 month (28 days) apart.\nJohnson & Johnsons Jansen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine requires only one dose.\nIf you receive a vaccine that requires two doses, you should get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, your second dose may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose, if necessary. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval.\n\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems should receive an additional dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after the initial 2 doses."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "What are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?",
        "faqanswer": "After receiving the vaccine, some people may experience redness or pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, or chills. These reactions occur less often in people over the age of 55, and most are harmless and do not last long.\n\nCertain issues (such as a cold or gastroenteritis) may arise by chance and are unrelated to the vaccine.\n\nThese vaccines cannot cause COVIDâ19 because they do not contain the SRASâCoVâ2 virus responsible for the disease. However, people who came in contact with the virus in the days leading up to their vaccine or who come in contact with it in the 14 days after being vaccinated could still develop COVIDâ19. Itâs important to continue applying health measures until a majority of the population has been vaccinated."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "Can I catch the virus even if I've received the vaccine?",
        "faqanswer": "The vaccines cannot cause COVIDâ19 because they do not contain the SRASâCoVâ2 virus responsible for the disease. However, people who came in contact with the virus in the days leading up to their vaccine or who come in contact with it in the 14 days following their vaccine could still develop COVID-19."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "Can I stop applying sanitary measures when i received the vaccine?",
        "faqanswer": "The beginning of vaccination does not mean the end of health measures. It will take many months to protect a large enough portion of the population. Everyone should continue to keep a distance of two metres, wear a mask or face covering, and frequently wash their hands until further notice."
      },
      {
        "faqheader": "Will the COVID-19 vaccines protect me against new variants?",
        "faqanswer": "Understanding of COVID-19 variants is changing all the time. Research is ongoing to determine if new variants affect how effective the authorized vaccines are at preventing infection and disease.\n\nEven if a COVID-19 vaccine isnât as effective against a variant, people who have received two doses will have better protection against both getting the virus and getting sick from the virus. Thatâs why itâs so important to get your second dose.\n\nThe vaccine also protects against variants in another way. The more a virus spreads to people, the greater chance it may mutate and potentially become a variant. The more people who are vaccinated, the better to help slow the spread and reduce the chance of new variants."
