Messenger RNA means the vaccine gives your body instructions for how to make a part of the Covid-19 virus (the \"spike protein\" on the outside of the virus) that is harmless on its own. Your body makes that harmless part of the virus. When your immune system runs into that new thing that it does not recognize as being part of you, your immune system figures out how to destroy the part. When the immune system has fought off the part once, if it encounters the full virus later, it knows how to destroy the part it already recognizes. Without its missing part, the virus cannot survive.<br><br>Messenger RNA does not last in the body. Once your immune system has learned to recognize the virus, it doesn't need the messenger RNA anymore.

The group included people who were over 65 years old, who were pregnant, who had chronic illnesses, as well as many people who were younger, not pregnant, and who had no chronic illnesses.

The needle filled with salt water is called a placebo. The people in the study were not told until after the study was over whether they had gotten the vaccine or the placebo.
