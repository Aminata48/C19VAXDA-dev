Messenger RNA means the vaccine gives your body instructions for how to make a part of the Covid-19 virus (the \"spike protein\" on the outside of the virus) that is harmless on its own. Your body makes that harmless part of the virus. When your immune system runs into that new thing that it does not recognize as being part of you, your immune system figures out how to destroy the part. When the immune system has fought off the part once, if it encounters the full virus later, it knows how to destroy the part it already recognizes. Without its missing part, the virus cannot survive.<br><br>Messenger RNA does not last in the body. Once your immune system has learned to recognize the virus, it doesn't need the messenger RNA anymore. The vaccine does not change your DNA.<br><br>This vaccine requires two doses to provide full protection, because your immune system may need a reminder to make sure it recognizes and knows how to fight off the virus.
